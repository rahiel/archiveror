Archiveror is a browser extension that archives webpages by submitting them to
[archive.is][], [archive.org][] and other archiving services. These archives are
publicly available, so you then have a backup that you can refer to in case the
original falls prey to [link rot][].

Archiveror also preserves your bookmarks by automatically archiving them in the
background. Its icon changes when you visit a bookmark it has archived, clicking
on it shows the archive links. Archiving of bookmarks happens when you make a
new bookmark and when you open an old bookmark. This can be disabled.

You can manually archive webpages by clicking on the icon, using the Alt+Shift+Y
hotkey (configurable), via the page's right click context menu, or by
right-clicking on links on a page. The URL for the archive is then copied to
your clipboard, so you can easily paste the link for references and citations.

Happy archiving!

## Local Saving

Archiveror also makes local copies of webpages. It saves one webpage in a single
[MHTML][] file. Save pages manually by either clicking the button or by pressing
Ctrl+Shift+S. The filenames end with the UTC date and time of when the archive
was made.

To enable local archiving of bookmarks, right click the Archiveror button, go to
the options and then select "MHTML" at the "Bookmarks" section. With this option
enabled your bookmarks will be saved in your Downloads directory following your
bookmark structure. If you move your bookmarks around, Archiveror will mirror
your changes and likewise move your local archives. For this to work you need to
check "Allow access to file URLs" at the extensions page. Go to your extensions
and enable it:
